# Telling-Stories-With-Data-Final-Project
My TSWD Final Project [2022]

The 'Telling Stories with data' course is offered by PES University and the course is mentored by Prof. Rituparna Jawahar. In this repository, I have stored all the content involved in the different parts(3) of submissions of the final Project. 

Further details -
Topic: Google Playstore data analysis.
Year: 2022
Grade obtained: A

The final project was divided into 3 parts -
1. The first part was choosing appropriate dataset. 
2. Creative Brief - The second part of the assignment is called Creative brief. The second portion of the final project serves as the blueprint for what you will develop as a final visualisation. It should outline objectives, audience, message, context, and an overview of the design elements. In short, the what, who, where, and when of the visualisation you will create.
3. Final Infographic submission.

Note:- For designing the final infographic, I have only used the features present in MS Powerpoint & not any external sites or apps.
