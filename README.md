<h3>The final project was divided into 3 parts -</h3>
1. The first part was <strong>choosing appropriate dataset</strong>. I have chosen the Google playstore dataset obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps">Kaggle</a>.<br>
2. <a href="https://github.com/Viztruth/Google-Play-store-Data-Analysis/blob/main/TSWD%20FINAL%20PROJECT%20PART%202.pdf"><strong>Creative Brief</strong></a> - The second part of the assignment is called Creative brief. The second portion of the final project serves as the blueprint for what you will develop as a final visualisation. It should outline objectives, audience, message, context, and an overview of the design elements. In short, the what, who, where, and when of the visualisation you will create.<br>
3. <a href="https://github.com/Viztruth/Google-Play-store-Data-Analysis/blob/main/TSWD%20Final%20Infographic.pdf"><strong>Final Infographic submission</strong></a><br><br>

Note:- For designing the final infographic, I have only used MS Powerpoint features.
